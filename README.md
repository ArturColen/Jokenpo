# Creating the Jokempô game

The project developed through a class offered by [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me) consists in the creation of the game Jokenpô (or rock, paper, and scissors) with the Java programming language. 

# 🔨 Project functionality
Besides introducing the study of this programming language, the program is intended to entertain users through this game (which runs on the terminal), in which they will play against the machine/Artificial Intelligence (AI).
